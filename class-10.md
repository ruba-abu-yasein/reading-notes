# Stack

### is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out)

**There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen.** **The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed, i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So, it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.**

_Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:_

1. PREPARE
2. EXECUTE

#### What an Error objects do ?

_Error objects can help you find where your mistakes are and browsers have tools to help you read them_

**there are two things you can do with the errors**

1. DEBUG THE SCRIPT TO FIX ERRORS
2. HANDLE ERRORS GRACEFULLY

**_The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script, where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be._**

#### HOW TO LOOK AT ERRORS IN CHROME??

**The console will show you when there is an error in your JavaScript. It also displays the line where it became a problem for the interpreter**
**You can also just type code into the console and it will show you a result.**

## Console Object

**The Console object provides access to the browser's debugging console.**

**_Console method:_**

- log()
- error()
- warn()
- clear()
- time() and timeEnd()
- table()
- count()
- group() and groupEnd()
- custom console logs

### BREAKPOINTS

**You can pause the execution of a script on any line using breakpoints. Then you can check the values stored in variables at that point in time**
**If you set multiple breakpoints, you can step through them one-by-one to see where values change and a problem might occur.**
**If you know something might cause a problem for your script, you can generate your own errors before the interpreter creates them.**
