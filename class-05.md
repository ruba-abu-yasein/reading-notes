# Images

**Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.**

**_To add an image into the page you need to use an < img > element_**
**Always specify both the height and width attributes for images. If height and width are set, the space required for the image is reserved when the page is loaded. However, without these attributes, the browser does not know the size of the image, and cannot reserve the appropriate space to it. The effect will be that the page layout will change during loading (while the images load).**
**Three Rules for Creating Images**

- Save images in the right format
- Save images at the right size
- Use the correct resolution

_You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format_

## Color:

_The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:_

1. rgb values
2. rgb values
3. color names

**Understanding Color**

_Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker._
_CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA_

**Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:**

- < b > - Bold text
- < strong > - Important text
- < I > - Italic text
- < em > - Emphasized text
- < mark > - Marked text
- < small > - Smaller text
- < del > - Deleted text
- < ins > - Inserted text
- < sub > - Subscript text
- < sup > - Superscript text

**Responding to Users hover , active , focus**

**You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented**
