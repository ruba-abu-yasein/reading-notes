# Growth mindset

**_Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts)_**

**Having a growth mindset is important because it can help you overcome the difficulties you might go through when learning something new or developing a new skill. Growth mindsets recognize the importance of persistence and determination. By changing the way you think, you can change the way of learning**

I can keep myself in a growth mindset through:

1.Try different learning tactics.

2.Follow the research on brain plasticity.

3.Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”
