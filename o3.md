We have two types of elements:
Block elements : appear to start on a new line in
the browser window
< h1 >, < p >, < ul >, and < li >

same line 
< a >, < b >, < em >, and < img >.**

The <header >and <footer> are elements can be used for:
The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site, The< nav > element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation The < article > element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated, the <div> > element will remain an important way to group together related elements*

Site maps create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site
WireFrames is away to organize the information in the website before we start coding and to picture the finale result going to appear  , Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand)
Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.
