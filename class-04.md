### HTML Links

_The HTML < a > tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:_
_< a href="url" >link text</a>_

**The most important attribute of the < a > element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination**

_The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader._
_Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address
Directory Structure_
**it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder.**

#### What is a Relative URL?

**A relative URL provides only the tag of an absolute URL**
**You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to**
**Multiple Select box**

_The multiple attribute is a boolean attribute._
_When present, it specifies that multiple options can be selected at once_

**_What the use of type="submit" ?_**
_The submit button is used to send a form to the server_

#### WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

**We'll talk about what Functions allow us to do its let you to group a series of phrases together to make a file Specific task. If different parts of the script repeat the same task, you can Reuse of function (instead of repeating the same set of phrases)**
**the statements in a function are not always executed when a page loads , so its offer a way to store the steps needed to achieve a task ,the script can then ask the function to perform all of those steps as and when they are required , Some functions need to be provided with information in order to achieve a given task You can also have anonymous name, so they cannot be called Instead, they are executed as soon as the interpreter comes across them**
**With the call() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects**

- the statement that perform the task sit in a code block: {
  Statement;
  }
  Calling a function

#### Why we use Expressions?

**They can be used where values are expected**

**Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed**

## Pair Programming

**_pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together._**

**_As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa._**

### Why pair program?

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness
