### What are the three list types in HTML?
* unordered list — used to group a set of related items in no particular order
* ordered list — used to group a set of related items in a specific order
* description list — used to display name/value pairs such as terms and definition

#### box dimensions:
*The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, its  the most popular method because they allow designers to accurately control their size*

#### Limiting Width:

* Max-width property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide
* Min-width property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow

***How do you limit the height of a box?***
 **This is achieved using the min-height and max-height properties**

***What is The overflow property?***
* Its tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself It has tow values:*
* Hidden(hides any extra content that does not fit in the box)
* Scroll(adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content)
* Hiding the overflow on such boxes helps prevent items overlapping on the page.*

#### Border, Margin , Padding:
**Border  : separates the edge of one box from another**
**Margin  : sit outside the edge of the border**
**Padding : the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it**

***what the use of The display property?***
* turn an inline element into a block-level element or vice versa
* hide an element from the page

***What visibility property do ?***
**its allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been. And it  can take two values:**
* hidden(hides the element)
* visible(shows the element)

*CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders*

***What is the array?***
*JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable*
*There is (NUMBERING ITEMS , ACCESSING ITEMS and NUMBER OF ITEMS) in array*

***if statement:***
*where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code*
***if/else statement:***
*part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.*

**what is the switch statement ?**

*The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case.*

**an if-else statement can evaluate almost all the types of data such as integer, floating-point, character, pointer, or Boolean. A switch statement can evaluate either an integer or a character.**
***What Are Truthy and Falsy Values?***
*Truthy values are expressions that evaluate to the boolean value of true, and falsy values are expressions that evaluate to the boolean value of false. I have included a table with expressions that are falsy.*


***Loops: are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value  types of loops are the while loop and the for loop***
