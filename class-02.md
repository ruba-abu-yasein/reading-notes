### Headings
**HTML has six "levels" of headings (h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)**
**We use it according to importance**

### Paragraphs
**Paragraphs tag < p >write hereâ€¦</ p >**
*To make word appear bold write:*
**< b > word</b>**
*To make word appear italic write:*
**<i>word</i>**
*To add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag :*
**< br/ >**
*To create a break between themes write :*
**< hr / >**

#### What is the empty elements?
*elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag*
*The em element is just one example of how HTML tags add semantic meaning textual content*
**There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations:**
*The < blockquote > tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source*
*The element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph*
**Why we use html elements?**
*to describe the structure of the page (headings, subheadings, paragraphs)*

***What is CSS?***
**CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets**
**CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media**
**CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.**
**CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements**
**CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration**

***CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:***
*Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements*
*Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section*
*External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file*

**How Css Rules Cascade?**

*when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used*
*If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence*
*add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules*

ont-family property is inherited by child elements. It saves you from having to apply these properties to as many elements
background-color or border properties; they are not inherited by child elements

**Why use External Style Sheets?**
*the benefits of using an external style sheet are: everything is stored within a single file. once changed/updated, the changes are reflected on all other pages that reference the style sheet. this makes it easier to maintain larger websites*

#### statements:
*A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
*Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement end with a semicolon.
*statements are designed to work independently of any JavaScript object

**what is the code blocks ?**
*statements are surrounded by curly braces*
**why we write comments?**
 *to explain what your code does. And help make your code easier to read and understand*
**how to write a comment in JavaScript?**
*JavaScript comment block (also known as the multi-line comment) begins with */ , while a single line comment starts with //*

#### Variable 
*means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.* 
*JavaScript variables were solely declared using the var keyword*
#### DATA TYPES:
1. Numbers
2. Strings
3. Booleans
**RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES:**
*You cannot use keywords or reserved words
*The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number
*The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name
*Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores
**Array:**
*JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable*
**Example**
***var cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");***

#### EXPRESSIONS
*An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value*
*EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE*
*EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE*
#### OPERATORS
**allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values**
1.	ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
2.	COMPARISON OPERATORS ( = = ) -( != ) -( = = = ) - ( != = )
3.	LOGICAL OPERATORS( && ) - ( || ) -( ! )
4.	STRING OPERATORS
*There are two components to a decision:*
*Evaluation of condition:returns a value
*Conditional statement:says what to do in given situation
*using expression with comparison operator* 
*the operand does not have to be signle value or variable name ,it can be expression*

#### if statement:
**where if a condition is true it is used to specify execution for a block of code**
#### if/else statement:
**part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.**
