# HTML Images Syntax

**_The HTML < img > tag is used to embed an image in a web page._**
**Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The < img > tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.**
**The < img > tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag**

_The <img> tag has two required attributes:_

- src - Specifies the path to the image
- alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

**The first, optional parameter of the image() notation is the directionality of the image. If included, and the image is used on an element with opposite directionality, the image will be flipped horizontally in horizontal writing modes. If the directionality is omitted, the image won't be flipped if the language direction is changed.**

**One key difference between url() and image() is the ability to add a media fragment identifier — a starting point along the x and y axis, along with a width and height — onto the image source to display only a section of the source image.**

**The section of the image defined in the parameter becomes a standalone image**

**To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.**

_In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability._

1. Page Title
2. URL / Web Address
3. Headings
4. Text
5. Link Text
6. Image Alt Text
7. Page Descriptions
