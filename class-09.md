# Forms


**The < form > element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.**

***There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site:***

1. ADDING TEXT:

* Text input (single-line)	

*Used for a single line of text such as email addresses and names*

* Password input

*Like a single line text box but it masks the characters entered.*

* Text area (multi-line)

 *For longer areas of text, such as messages and comments.*

2. Making Choices.
3. Submitting Forms
4. Uploading Files

 **HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.**

**Many forms need to gather information such as dates, email addresses, and URLs. This has traditionally been done using text inputs**






## HTML tables

**Tables can be a useful way of organising content on a web page, particularly text.**

**A table is defined with the < table > tag.** 
**Each row in the table is defined with the < tr > tag.**
**A table heading is defined with the < th > tag. (Headings are bold and centred by default.)**
**Each cell of data in the table is defined with the < td > tag.**
