### Read: 14a - CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations
**Transforms**
**The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.**
***What is the syntax for the transform ?**
**syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.**
- It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once, rotating and scaling the size of an element at the same time for example. In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. To combine transforms, list the transform values within the transform property one after the other without the use of commas.

- Behind every transform there is also a matrix explicitly defining the behavior of the transform. Using the rotate, scale, transition, and skew values provide an easy way to establish this matrix

- Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple key frames. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different key frames

***It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point. Colors, font sizes, and the alike may be transitioned from one value to another as they have recognizable values in-between one another. The display property, for example, may not be transitioned as it does not have any midpoint. A handful of the more popular transitional properties include the following.***
- background-color
- background-position
- border-color
- border-width
- border-spacing
- bottom
- clip
- color
- crop
- font-size
- weight
- height
- left
- letter-spacing
- line-height
- margin
- max-height
- max-width
- min-height
- min-width
- opacity
- outline-color
- outline-offset
- outline-width
- padding
- right
- text-indent
- text-shadow
- top
- vertical-align
- visibility
- width
- word-spacing
- z-index
- Animations also provide the ability to further customize an elementâ€™s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.

**It is important for people in the same group to have social contact with each other and for all of them to have the same speaking time during meetings.**

*** 'As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined. ***
**Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it's sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences**
