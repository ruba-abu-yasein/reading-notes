# Expressions

**Comparison operators :**
***You can evaluate asituation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it it might be the result will be a booleam : true or false***

*( == )Used to compare two values to see if they are equal 
*Example: 2==3 the result is false*
*( != ) Used to compare two values to see if they are not equal
*Example: “good”!= “hi” the result is true*
*( === ) Used to compare two values to see if they are equal in the value and data type(both)
*Example:2===”2” the result is false*  
*( !== ) Used to compare two values to see if they arenot  equal in the value and data type(both)
*Example : 8!==”8” the result is true*

**Condition  can be much complex than those shown here but they usually result in a value of true or false**

*( > ) It is used to ensure that the number on the left is greater than the number on the right
*Example ::5>10 the result is false* 
*( < ) ) It is used to ensure that the number on the left is less  than the number on the right
*Example ::5<10 the result is true*
*( >= ) It is used to ensure that the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right
*Example ::5>=10 the result is false*
*( <=  )  It is used to ensure that the number on the left is less  than  or equal to the number on the right
*Example ::20<=10 the result is false*

***We can compare three expressions***
*The result on the left and the right is true or false (they are Comparison operators)The third expression is a logical operator ( && ) It is used to ensure that the results on the right and on the left are true*

*Example :: ( ( 10>3 ) && (20<10 )) the result is false*

**We can compare three expressions**
*The result on the left and the right is true or false (they are Comparison operators) The third expression is a logical operator* 

**Logical operators:**

1.( && ) It is used to ensure that the results on the right and on the left are true
*Example:: ( ( 10>3 ) && (20<10 )) the result is false*
2.( || ) It gives true result if the result of any expression (left or right) is true
*Example:: ( ( 10>3 ) ||  (20<10 )) the result is true*
3.( ! ) Gives a true result if the result of the expression is false (gives the opposite of the result)
*Example: ! ( 2>1 ) the result is false*

## Loops:

***There are different types of loops, and the important thing is that they do one thing: they repeat some actions several times. Loops of all kinds provide different ways to determine the start point and end point of a loop.***
#### Loops type :
*For :
*The for loop does not stop repeating until the condition specified with false is met*
*While:
*The while loop will continue executing the associated code as long as the specified condition is true.*
